Therefore, there is no way to\n'pass' or 'fail' this test file, even though the text does suggest a\npreferable decoder behaviour at some places. Its aim is, instead, to\nhelp you think about and test the behaviour of your UTF-8 decoder on\nsystematic collection of unusual inputs. Experience so far suggests\nthat most first-time authors of UTF-8 decoders find at least one\nserious problem in their decoder using this file.\n",
